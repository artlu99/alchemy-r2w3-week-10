## Lens-AL [by @artlu.lens](https://lenster.xyz/u/artlu.lens)

A read-only / gated community, inspired by the [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) [Road to Web3](https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/road-to-web3/welcome-to-the-road-to-web3) [Week 10](https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/road-to-web3/weekly-learning-challenges/10.-how-to-create-a-decentralized-twitter-with-lens-protocol).

## A Decentralized Social Network with Lens Protocol ðŸŒ¿

- Next.js w/ Apollo GraphQL client
- Lens Protocol via Lens API

## Roadmap / Major milestones

1. âœ… show NFTs owned by this profile/address pair ðŸ—¸
2. âœ… show each profile's Following profiles ðŸ—¸
      1. âœ… replace "recommendedProfiles" with "members of R2W3 community" based on Follows ðŸ—¸
3. âœ… show comments on posts ðŸ—¸
4. read from json for global config variables (e.g., initial Follow address, page limits)
5. dark mode
6. navbar / breadcrumbs at top/bottom of page (e.g., quick links to Lenster)
8. Lit Protocol SDK to token-gate access for MintKudos token holders
9. paging of API call results
   1. show other (arbitrary) profile attributes set by dApps, such as the list of attributes
10. replace Lens API call to get NFTs, with Alchemy NFT API call (slightly cleaner, simpler)

### Technical debt
1. Apollo "ensure all objects of type MetadataOutput have an ID"
2. recurse-with-limits instead of tree-based navigation. comments-on-comments should appear correctly

### Deploy

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). The easiest way to deploy a Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js. Further details in the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment).
